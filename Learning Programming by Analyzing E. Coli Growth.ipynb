    "Suppose you've been given a grant to study how antibiotics affect the bacteria *E. coli*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to measure the growth rate of *E. coli* grown in various concentrations of the antibiotic Chloramphenicol. For the experiment, you grew *E. coli* in a liquid broth with antibiotic. You expect that *E. coli* populations will initially grow exponentially, and the rate of this exponential growth will depend on the antibiotic concentration in the culture. Higher concentrations of antibiotic lead to lower growth rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can measure *E. coli* population size by how much light they absorb. An automated instrument recorded the size of E. coli populations over time in various antibiotic concentrations. The instrument collected the data and stored it in a text file, but you'll need to analyze it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyze the data, you will learn how to do a few things. First, you will learn how to store data and operate on data in Python. Second, you will learn how to get data and tools from outside Python into Python. Third, you'll learn how to plot data in Python, including labeling axes and adding legends. Fourth, you'll learn how to do repeat operations in Python without typing too much. Finally, you'll learn how to define functions in Python so you can build tools to do what you need.\n",

This spreadsheet is \"MG1655 Chloramphenicol 10 Feb averages simplified sheet.csv\". This is a plain text file, but it's easier to understand when viewed in Excel or another spreadsheet program. Please open the file now in your spreadsheet program. The top row of the file is the times at which the measurements were taken. Each row afterwards is the optical density of an *E. coli* sample over time.\n",

The times in the top row are in seconds. *E. coli* have growth rates on the order of hours not seconds. You decide you're going to need to convert the seconds to hours.

    "\n",
    "1. Although names like \"x\" are acceptable for variables sometimes, *you should usually give your variables names that help you or someone else understand their purpose*.\n",
    "2. The **#** sign tells Python to ignore any text starting at the # sign and until the next return. This text doesn't mean anything in Python. It's so you can embed explanations of what you are doing in your code. These are called comments. You shouldn't comment every line, but you should do it whenever something would be unclear to someone reading your code- _**especially yourself 6 months later!**_ Here I've commented the arithmetic operations where python uses symbols for them that are not the mathematical standard.\n",
    "3. \"print\" is a Python **function**. Python functions are like mathematical functions in that they take some inputs (sometimes 0 inputs) and produce some outputs. You evaluate a python function for some particular inputs by writing <code>function_name(input1, input2, input3,...)</code> except with the correct number of inputs and no \"...\" after. This is called **calling** the function. The inputs to a function are called its **arguments**. You can write code once for a function then easily reuse it whenever you need it. The \"print\" function outputs text. It is extremely useful. It lets you send messages to people using your programs and helps you inspect and debug your programs.\n",
    "4. The letters inside ' ' are **strings**. Strings are text. Python has many datatypes, but some of the most basic and important ones are **integers** (mathematical integers), **floats** (a finite precision approximation of real numbers), and **strings** (text). The print function will print most characters in strings as you see them in the string. The print function prints the value of variables. And you can put multiple things together with print by separating them with commas.\n",

Use descriptive variable names. Then output some text stating how many seconds there are per hour. Do not print just the value.

You tell Python you're defining a new function with the <code>def</code> keyword. Then put a space, then a function name then parentheses with the names of any inputs (arguments) the function will take inside the parentheses. You then have to put a colon and go to the next line. On the next line, indent by four spaces. **_The four spaces are syntactically meaningful to python and any code with that indentation will be part of the function until you unindent._** If you want the function to have any output, you'll need to put a <code>return</code> followed by the value you want the function to return. Here's an example function that counts the number of characters in a string (don't actually use this function, python already has its own function for this)"
